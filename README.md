## Required API
CrowdSec Monitor gets it's data from an intermediate API between the app and CrowdSec's LAPI. This API caches the data and offers it with more filtering options. In order to use this app, you have to deploy this API next to your CrowdSec instance, on the same machine.

This API is available [here](https://github.com/JGeek00/crowdsec-monitor-api).
